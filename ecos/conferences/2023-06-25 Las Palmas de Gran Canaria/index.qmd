# Conference Objectives

The purpose of the Conference is to provide a forum for participants to present new research results and exchange views on performance, economics, and environmental impact of energy systems, their design and possible advancements. Submission of applied and fundamental science papers are encouraged. We cordially welcome participants from all over the world to submit papers. We expect that you will enjoy a fruitful week at the conference and we are looking forward to hosting the ECOS community in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in June 2023.
